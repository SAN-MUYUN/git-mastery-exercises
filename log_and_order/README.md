# log-and-order

You are tasked with tracking down a criminal who was on a crime spree and has managed to escape. He has hidden his crimes in his log which he stores as a commit history, along with the victims of his crimes and the times he has committed them.

## Task

Use `git log` to track down his crime spree and answer the following questions:

1. Where is he currently hiding at? (which SHA hash does `HEAD` point to?)
2. When did he rob Alice Bakersfield? (find the date of the commit whose description details the robbery)
3. What is the criminal's real name? (find the commit whose author is not "Anonymous")
4. What did the criminal do on 13 September 2024? (what is the description of the commit on 13 September 2024?)
5. What was the very first crime he had committed? (what is the message of the very first commit?)

Answer these questions in the `answers.txt` file and run `gitmastery verify` to check if your answers are right!
