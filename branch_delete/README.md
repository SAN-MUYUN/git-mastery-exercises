# branch-delete


## Task

You have two branches: `fix-scrolling-bug` and `improve-loading` and you need to delete them!

`fix-scrolling-bug` has already been merged while `improve-loading` hasn't yet been merged. But you realize that you don't need the changes anymore, so you should not be merging it.

1. Delete the `fix-scrolling-bug` branch
2. Delete the `improve-loading` branch safely
