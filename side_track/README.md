# side-track

You realized that something is broken with your project and want to fix it. But you are also currently working on a major feature on `main` right now
and you don't want to push that major feature yet.

## Task

### Task 1

Create a bug fix branch named `bug-fix` and go to the branch.

### Task 2

On `bug-fix`, open the `greet.py` file and ensure that the `greet` function prints the `name` variable, not just `Alice`.

Commit and save the fix.

### Task 3

On `bug-fix`, open the `calculator.py` file and ensure that the `add` function returns the sum of two numbers.

Commit and save the fix.

### Task 4

Return to the `main` branch where you're working on your major feature.
